 <h2 align="left">  INTRODUCTION</h2>
 <h3>This repository contains Python code to print digits using nested loops. Each digit is represented by a pattern of + symbols arranged to form the shape of the digit. The current implementation includes patterns for the digits 0 to 9, as well as a combined pattern for digits 1 and 0 printed in a single line.</h3>

 <h2 align="left">  how it works </h2>
 <h3>Single Digit Patterns: Each digit pattern is created using nested loops with specific conditions to match the shape of the digit.
Combined Digit Patterns: The digits 1 and 0 are printed next to each other in a single line using nested loops. </h3>

<h2 align="center"> Printing Combined Digit Patterns</h2>

<h3>This code will print the digits "1" and "0" next to each other in a single line. The conditions for each digit are designed to match their respective shapes:

For "1":

The vertical line is formed by j == 3.
The top of the "1" is formed by (i == 1 and j == 2).
The diagonal at the top is formed by (i == 2 and j == 1).
For "0":

The top and bottom rows are filled except for the corners: (i == 1 or i == 7) and (j > 1 and j < 5).
The sides are filled: (j == 1 or j == 5) and (i > 1 and i < 7).</h3>
